The Weather Dataset

This is a time-series dataset with per-hour information about the weather conditions at a particular location. It records Temperature, Dew Point Temperature. 
Relative Humidity, Wind Speed, Visibility, Pressure and Conditions.

The dataset is a CSV file, I will use Pandas to analyze the data and answer the following questions:

1. Find all the uniques wind speed values in the data.
2. Find the number of times when the weather was exactly clear.
3. Find the mumber of the times the wind speed was exactly 4km/h.
4. What is the mean Visibility, Standard Deviation of Pressure, variance of Relative humididty?
5. Find all instances when snow was recorded.
6. Find all instances when wind speed is above 24 and visibility is 25.
7. What is the mean value of each column agains each weather condition.
8. What is the min, max value of each column against the weather conditons.
9. Show all the records where weather condition is fog.
10.Find all instances when weather is clear and visibility is above 40.
11.Find instances when weather is clear and humidity is greater than 50 or visibility is above 40.
12.Plot the time series.
